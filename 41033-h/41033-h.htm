    <h3 class="ActI" id="Act_One">ACT I.</h3>

    <p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>—<i>A hall; passages, <span class="stage">R.</span> and <span class="stage">L.;</span> a double window of stained glass, on swivel hinges, opens upon a lawn, with view of grounds; large portrait on the wall; landscape, and mirror; a staircase, <span class="stage">L.</span> <span class="name">Tom Potter</span> discovered working at an easel placed near the open window; <span class="name">Ned Chetwynd</span> seated at a table, opening and destroying letters leisurely. <span class="name">Lucy Preston</span> watching him; <span class="name">Mrs. Dozey</span> asleep in an armchair, with a book of sermons lying open in her lap; footstool; fireplace, <span class="stage">R.;</span> large armchair side of fireplace.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> You’ve a great many letters?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> A few friends inquiring after me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> More creditors?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> A regular assortment. I have ’em of all sizes—big and little; of all styles—polite to peremptory; of all nations—Jew and Gentile. (<i>opens another letter</i>) Another lawyer’s letter! (<i><span class="name">Lucy</span> goes up to <span class="name">Tom</span></i>) “Unless the amount, together with our charges, five and sixpence, be at once remitted——” Just so—common form. (<i>opens another letter</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Getting on, Mr. Potter?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Famously.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> I can begin to make out what it’s going to be.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Don’t say that, please.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Why not?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> I shall be told I am a servile copyist without a soul.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Soul? What is “soul”?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> The gift of representing things as they don’t exist.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Surely that isn’t a gift. Isn’t it art to show things as they are?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Not in the least. That’s realism.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Then what’s art?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> That’s art. (<i>points to portrait, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Sir Humphrey’s portrait.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> (<i>crosses to portrait, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>) I beg your pardon—whose?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Sir Humphrey’s. Can’t you see the likeness?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Has anybody seen it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Of course! a score of people.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> It’d take a score. (<i>crosses to easel</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> (<i>turns to <span class="name">Tom</span></i>) It is by Sir Clarence Gibbs, the Royal Academician, and it cost five hundred guineas.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Ah! If I could only paint like that. (<i>looks at portrait</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> (<i>looking at picture</i>) Perhaps you will in time.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Never. I may deteriorate, but I shall never be as bad as that. (<i>looking at picture</i>) Now, look at this aggravating thing. After all my trouble you can positively tell what it’s meant for. (<i><span class="name">Ned</span> rises and joins them</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Yes, two knights, on horseback, fighting.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> What are you going to call it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> The Silver Shield.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Silver Shield? (<i>crosses to back of easel; <span class="name">Ned</span> leans on back of chair</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Haven’t you heard the fable? Two knights, riding in opposite directions, passed a shield, hung on a tree to mark a boundary, and meeting some time afterwards, one of them happened to make some remark about the Silver Shield they had both ridden past. “Silver,” exclaimed the other, “it was gold.” Then they disputed, and words came to blows. They fought, and killed each other. When they were both dead, it occurred to somebody to examine the shield, when it turned out that it was gold on one side, and silver on the other.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> What jackasses those two knights must have been.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> So remarked everybody.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Well, they <i>were</i> rather silly. (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Mrs. Dozey,</span> <span class="stage">R.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> No sillier than we are, who see a fool in the looking-glass, and don’t recognise him.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> (<i>waking with a start</i>) Bless me! I’ve been asleep.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> For two hours, Mrs. Dozey.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> I beg everybody’s pardon. The fact is, I thought I was in church, and Dionysius was preaching.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> That sent you off to sleep. (<i>sitting on edge of chair</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> Oh, no, that woke me up. I wouldn’t miss one of his discourses for the world. This is a splendid one I’m reading now—the 22nd, in the 17th volume.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> You have got so far?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> Yes, my dear; I’ve read sixteen volumes of the twenty. The set were given to me by my husband on our honeymoon. Imagine my delight. I’ve been reading at them steadily for five and twenty years, and my only fear is that I shan’t live to finish them.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Take warning, Lucy, and begin them young.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> Shall I lend you the first volume?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Thanks; I can get it from the library.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> I’m sure you’d like it, Mr. Potter.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Unfortunately, I am going home to-day, and shouldn’t have time to do it justice. (<i>meanwhile <span class="name">Dr. Dozey</span> has entered absently, his eyes cast down, his hands behind his back</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> (<i>raising his eyes</i>) Going home?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> Ah, here’s the doctor! (<i>dozes off again</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> Home! sweet home! The very phrase is fraught with poetry. One seems to stand before the glowing fire, to hear the purring cat, the hissing urn, whilst from without a quaint but welcome cry heralds the advent of the evening milk on its accustomed round. If you are wishful to pursue the subject——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> (<i>crosses in front to staircase</i>) Excuse me, I must look after Sir Humphrey. (<i>Exit, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> (<i>turning to <span class="name">Ned</span></i>) I would refer you to——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Thank you very much, but I’ve some letters to answer. (<i>Exit, <span class="stage">R.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> (<i>turning to <span class="name">Tom</span></i>) To the tenth discourse——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> The light’s so bad here, I must go outside. (<i>Exit through window, <span class="stage">C.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> (<i>turning to <span class="name">Mrs. Dozey</span></i>) In my fifth volume.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> (<i>top of stairs, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>) See to it at once.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> Home I divide into three sections. First—— (<i><span class="name">Mrs. Dozey</span> snores, <span class="name">Dr. Dozey</span> stops and wakes her.</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> (<i>with <span class="name">Sir Humphrey,</span> top of stairs, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>) Will you take my arm?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Thanks, I need no assistance. (<i>stumbles and is obliged to take <span class="name">Lucy’s</span> arm</i>) Dear me, how bad my rheumatism is to-day.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> (<i>turns to <span class="name">Mrs. Dozey,</span> smiling grimly</i>) Poor Humphrey!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> (<i>rises</i>) He gets very feeble.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> (<i>to <span class="name">Lucy</span></i>) Mrs. Blake’s train is very nearly due. See if the brougham has been sent to meet her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> Mrs. Blake? (<i>Exit <span class="name">Lucy,</span> through window, <span class="stage">C.</span> and <span class="stage">L.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> A visitor whom we expect today. (<i>puts cap on table</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> A lady visitor?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Yes, a young widow, from Australia, whom we met on the Continent this summer, and whose society proved so agreeable (<i><span class="name">Dr.</span> and <span class="name">Mrs. Dozey</span> exchange glances</i>) to my ward, Miss Preston, that I invited her to visit us, when she returned to England.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> A widow. (<i>crosses in front to <span class="stage">L.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> An Australian widow. (<i>gets <span class="stage">R.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> It’s a long way off.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> Far be it from me, whose tenement is glass, to cut a stone; but of all types of widow, the most perilous is the Colonial.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> However, it’s our duty to be charitable.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> Until we know the worst we will think the best.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Wait till you’ve met Mrs. Blake; you’ll be charmed with her. (<i>meanwhile <span class="name">Tom</span> has re-entered through window and down <span class="stage">R.</span> of easel</i>) You mustn’t go till you have seen her, Mr. Potter. (<i>turns</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Till I’ve seen whom?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> A widow. (<i>moves towards door, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> A Colonial widow. (<i>moves towards door, <span class="stage">R.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> The doctor will have his joke.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> That’s fortunate, for no one else would take it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Very old friends of mine, and one must make allowances for age and infirmity. (<i>sitting with difficulty, <span class="stage">R.</span> of table</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Can I assist you? (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Sir Humphrey</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Not at all. It’s only a little stiffness in the joints. I never felt it till the last few years.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Ah, we’re all older than we used to be. (<i>goes to easel</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Not at all, Mr. Potter, not at all. I’m younger than I look. I have had trouble.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> You, Sir Humphrey!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> My son gives me a great deal of anxiety. His heart’s in the right place, I know, but he’s young, reckless, and extravagant. He’s taken to writing lately. A bad sign, Mr. Potter, a bad sign. I never knew a young man who took to writing come to any good. I’ve paid his debts more than once, and he won’t settle down. I found a charming wife for him, and he wouldn’t look at her. He has views of his own—very bad things to have. Why can’t men be content with the views of their forefathers? The opinions which are good enough for me ought to be good enough for a stripling like him.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Our forefathers believed the sun went round the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> And what better are we for believing the earth goes round the sun? I’ve no patience with these revolutionary ideas. They unsettle men’s minds. Of course you don’t agree with me. You are another man with views, and that’s the reason why you don’t get on.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> (<i>comes down <span class="stage">C.</span></i>) You don’t like me, Sir Humphrey. You are very kind and hospitable; but I know it’s only as a<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span> distant relative that you put up with me. I don’t wonder at it. You represent society; I represent Bohemia. This makes it difficult to say what I must say before I go.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> What is that, Mr. Potter?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> I want to ask your ward, Miss Preston, if she’ll be my wife. You’re astonished at my presumption—naturally.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Not quite that. What are Miss Preston’s feelings in the matter?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> I don’t know. I didn’t feel justified in speaking to her first.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> She is of full age, and can please herself.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Yes, but there’s something else. You know, I took my present name when I went in for art, to your disgust, on my return from abroad about five years ago; but of my previous history you know very little, and I must tell you part of it. I suppose you think I’m a bachelor?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Of course.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> I am a widower.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> You astound me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Yes, I once had a wife; but we weren’t happy—in fact, we separated.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> How long has she been dead?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> A few months after my return to England I saw her death announced in the newspapers.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> The newspapers!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> There is no irony like that of destiny, no cynic half as cynical as life. Two beings live together in one home, are bound together in one interest, are animated by one hope. Fate separates them. They go different ways, and after many days (<i>crosses to <span class="stage">R.</span></i>) they read about each other in the newspaper.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> She died abroad? Then you were never reconciled?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Reconciliation was impossible. I should prefer to say no more about it, (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Sir Humphrey,</span> <span class="stage">L.</span></i>) but I am bound to satisfy you I was not to blame. Those were the last words my wife wrote to me. (<i>gives a letter to <span class="name">Sir Humphrey</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> (<i>reads</i>) “Tom,—I love another more than I love you. Isn’t it best that we should say good-bye? I have no right to tell you I will never see you, for the fault is mine; but if I do, it will be only painful, and I leave it to your magnanimity to go away from me for ever.” (<i>returns letter to <span class="name">Tom</span></i>) Enough, Mr. Potter. (<i>rises</i>) There was a time when I disapproved of second marriages. They struck me as a species of inconstancy. But as one grows in years, these sentimental notions lose their force. One begins to realise the loneliness of life. You understand me?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Perfectly. The need of a companion.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> More than a companion—the need of a—of a—I want a word.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Nurse is the word you want.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> No, sir! It is the very word I do <i>not</i> want.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> I beg your pardon, I misunderstood you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Strange as it may sound, what you’ve just told me makes my task a little easier. Miss Preston also has a history. Her mother died when she was quite a child. Her father was my very oldest friend, whom I respected beyond everything, and it was only on his death, when I felt I could not repudiate the guardianship I’d undertaken, that I made a discovery which shocked me inexpressibly. I tell it you in confidence; I have told no one but my son, whom it was my duty to put upon his guard. Of course it puts an end to the proposal you have made, but, as a man of honour, I am bound to tell you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Well, sir?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> The girl is illegitimate. (<i>turning, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> What’s that?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> (<i>turns and stares at him</i>) Mr. Potter, you call yourself a Bohemian, but you are a distant—very distant—relative of my own, and you must have at least the instincts of a gentleman.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> I hope so.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Having those instincts, you will think no more of her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Having those instincts, I think all the more of her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> You’d marry her, after what I’ve told you? Then you have no respect for marriage.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> If I had no respect for marriage I shouldn’t marry her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> We will not argue, sir. Go your own way.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> I’ve your permission?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> But don’t hold me responsible, whatever happens.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> I am afraid, my love, that notwithstanding five and twenty years of my companionship, you have still a yearning after the pomps and vanities. And yet it is not the plaiting of hair or the putting on of real Valenciennes that constitutes respectability.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> The doctor knows the circumstances.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> (<i>down, <span class="stage">R.C.</span></i>) They were most distressing.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> But after all, some artists are successful, and a man must begin at the beginning. There’s nothing wicked about art, is there, doctor?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dr.</span> A perilous pursuit, and it is not the part of a wise man to play with fire. (<i><span class="name">Alma</span> pulls a long face, and is caught by <span class="name">Mrs. Dozey</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> I’ve no objection to a real artist, an Academician, such as Sir Clarence Gibbs, who painted my own portrait. A very gentlemanly man, indeed—received in the best families.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> I doubt it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> So do I. (<i>turning to easel</i>) Now there is talent in that picture. The man who did that shouldn’t have gone wrong.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Excuse me. If you were a manager, you would reject them without reading them.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Not yours. You are my oldest admirer.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> What nonsense! I never met you till last year.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Well, what of that? I’ve had a score since then, but they’ve all disappeared, and there you are still.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Faithful to the last.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> The last’s a long way off yet, Mr. Chetwynd. He’s trundling a hoop somewhere at this moment. But he’ll turn up. Each season brings its crop. They’re mostly annuals, my loves.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> I am an amaranth.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> That locket on your chain? Isn’t it the one you put my portrait in? (<i>rises to examine it</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Yes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> And he wears it still! You are an amaranth, indeed. (<i>about to open locket</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> You’d better not.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Do let me see. I’ve quite forgotten what I looked like then. (<i>opens it; kneels</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Just as you like.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> How I have altered!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> You look younger there.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> And my hair’s different.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> The fashion’s changed.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Yes, and the colour too. There! Shut it up. (<i>rises</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Twelve months make a difference.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Don’t they? My amaranth has faded like the rest! (<i>pause</i>) And pray, why do you wear Miss Preston’s photograph?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> (<i>after making sure that <span class="name">Mrs. Dozey</span> is asleep; rises</i>) Can you keep a secret?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> I’ve kept one for six years.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Miss Preston is my wife.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Your wife!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> You are so quick, I knew you’d find it out, or I<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span> should have said nothing. We don’t want anyone to know—at least, <i>I</i> don’t—just yet.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Doesn’t Sir Humphrey?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> No.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> I thought he was her guardian.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> She’s twenty-one. He’s not her guardian now.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> But he’s your father, and you’ve done a thing like this. She, too!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> It wasn’t her fault. It was mine, if it was anyone’s. But it was no use speaking to my father. Lucy wanted to, but I knew more than she did. The governor’s the best old fellow in the world, but upon certain points he is as obstinate as—as——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> His son.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> As I am, if you like.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Why was it no use speaking to him?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Because he would never have given his consent. The fact is, Lucy’s mother was separated from her husband. She married very young, and he left her before she was twenty. Not being able to get a divorce, of course she couldn’t marry again, and consequently Lucy’s father couldn’t marry her. That’s the whole mystery. Lucy doesn’t know it, but I did, and I knew it was useless talking. So we were married secretly, this year.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> And when do you propose to acknowledge your wife?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> I don’t know yet, (<i>crosses, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>) but when the right time comes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> The right time was the day you married her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Ah, it’s all very well to talk, but you have no idea how much it would hurt the governor. (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Alma</span></i>) It would have cut him to the heart.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> A very good reason for not marrying, but a very bad reason for concealing your marriage.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> It was to spare his feelings.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Don’t flatter yourself. It was to spare your own.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Well, it’s done now, and I can’t help it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> But you can. You can tell him to-day.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> (<i>sits <span class="stage">R.</span> of table</i>) That would be worse than telling him earlier.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Ned</span></i>) And better than telling him later. You’ve done wrong, and you’re doing wrong now. The only point in your favour is that you’re thoroughly ashamed of yourself. (<i>crosses to <span class="stage">R.C.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Ashamed! nay——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> I can see it in your face. No hoarding like a human countenance, and no bill-sticker like a guilty conscience.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Alma, I <i>am</i> ashamed.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> I’ll tell Sir Humphrey—to-morrow.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> To-day. (<i>holding her hands out</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Both.</span> (<i>shaking hands</i>) To-day.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> I’ll screw it up for you. You won’t want much. Fathers are not such dreadful animals after all. There was a time when children were afraid of their parents, but now-a-days they’re lucky parents who’re not afraid of their children. (<i>Re-enter <span class="name">Dr. Dozey,</span> <span class="stage">C.,</span> and down, <span class="stage">R.C.</span></i>) Aren’t they, doctor?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> I must introduce you to the painter.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Good gracious, no. I’ve only just begun.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Isn’t it time you dressed? The Dozeys will be here directly. I told them we should dine early.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Bother the Dozeys!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> I couldn’t help asking them. Indeed, they asked themselves. (<i>rises, crosses to <span class="stage">C.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Lucy, how can I write while you keep chattering? I particularly want to finish what I’m doing. I want to send it to Alma by to-night’s post.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Alma!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> What’s the matter?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> I wish you wouldn’t call Mrs. Blake “Alma.” I don’t like it!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> I don’t think you like <i>her.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> I like her very well; but at the same time I think you see too much of her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> What nonsense! We’re in the same set; I can’t help seeing a good deal of her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> That’s true enough—in some of her dresses.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Come, come. That’s only on the stage. She has to dress according to her part. She’s not responsible for its clothing.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> (<i>turning to <span class="name">Ned</span></i>) The stage is an excuse for a great deal.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> You mean, it’s an excuse for very little. Where had I got to? You’ve quite put me out.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> What are you writing that’s so very particular?</p>

(<i>writes</i>) “Fool that I was, I thought that it would last for ever. Nothing can now remove the barrier between us. With my own hand I have destroyed my happiness.” That’s warm enough, I think. I’m making an infernal scoundrel of my namesake, but no matter. (<i>reads</i>) “With my own hand”—I wonder if that’s right. Could he have destroyed his happiness with anybody else’s hand?

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Yes—spoiling more paper. I’m an annuity to the local stationer.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Well, perhaps in your old age the local butterman will be an annuity to you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Gad, I shall want one at the pace I’m going.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> But he makes us an allowance.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Yes. He hasn’t forgiven us, but he makes us an allowance. That’s the governor all over.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> And I suppose you spend a good deal more than he allows you? (<i>Lucy sits, <span class="stage">R.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Yes, that’s me all over.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Well, I won’t preach.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> For mercy’s sake! The doctor’s coming to dinner; he’ll preach quite enough.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> To do him justice, Ned, he doesn’t talk at dinner.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> To do the dinner justice, he does not.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Won’t you stay, Mr. Potter?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Do. I shan’t work any more to-day.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Thank you. I don’t dine as a rule, but I’ll make an exception.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> That’s right. You can keep Lucy company while I go and dress. I shan’t be very long. (<i>Exit, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> See where we’ve hung your wedding present. (<i>indicating the picture, <span class="stage">R.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Yes—I was looking at my knights—thinking how like Sir Humphrey is to them. Do you know, he’s never seen me since the day I left his house? I’ve tried to get at him a dozen times, but he won’t give me a chance of explaining<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-24">[Pg 24]</a></span> myself. He sees one side of the shield and won’t look at the other.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> I know he was very much annoyed with you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> <i>You</i> must have thought my conduct very strange.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> I did. (<i>sits, <span class="stage">R.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> I owe you an explanation as well as Sir Humphrey. You remember my telling you my married life was a failure?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Though you adored your wife.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> You mustn’t think she didn’t care for me, at first, but she was lively, high-spirited, demonstrative. (<i>fetches chair from back and sits beside <span class="name">Lucy</span></i>) And you know what sort of a fellow I am. Heavy as one of Dozey’s sermons. Women like pretty speeches, compliments. I can’t make pretty speeches, and I can’t pay compliments; but there are lots of men about who can. I wasn’t jealous, for a man can’t very well be jealous of a lap dog—and still less of half-a-dozen lap dogs at a time; but I lost my opinion of her (<i>rises</i>) and at last—— (<i>leans on back of chair</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> You told her so.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> I didn’t say very much; and what I said she didn’t seem to heed. When I had spoken I went out. Coming back presently I found a letter lying on her desk telling me she preferred another man, and asking me to leave her. I took her at her word. (<i>crosses to <span class="stage">C.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> You left her without seeing her again?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> She asked me <i>not</i> to see her, and where was the use? I had just spoken to her, and this was the result. I came to England, and the next I heard of her was the announcement of her death. (<i>crosses to sofa</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Abroad?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> In Melbourne. At first the sight of the old name brought back old memories, and I forgave her. I got out the few remnants the past leaves to men—the few pale letters and the faded photograph that grows a little dimmer every day—when my eyes fell on that last note I found upon her desk. I huddled up the scraps and went my way. I took up art as a profession—changed my name in deference to my family, who look on art as a mild form of felony—and time went on. I pulled the old things out again, and found that I could look at them unmoved. I even thought of marrying again, when, as I stood talking to you that last day at Sir Humphrey’s, there flashed on me a figure and a face so like my wife’s, it was like seeing <i>her.</i> And with the sight of her came back the love. (<i>crosses to <span class="stage">C.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> (<i>rises</i>) It wasn’t dead, then?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Does love ever die? Dark mists of prejudice may wrap it round, and it may set in clouds, but every now and<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-25">[Pg 25]</a></span> then the clouds are rolled away and there shines out on us once more the image of the woman we have loved.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Tom</span></i>) Was Mrs. Blake so like her?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> So like I dare not meet her. I could only go. I wasn’t in the mood for explanations, and when I was, Sir Humphrey wasn’t in the mood to listen to them.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> And you’ve seen neither of them since?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Yes. I saw Mrs. Blake upon the stage some weeks ago, and in her I recognised, beyond all doubt, my wife.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Your wife—Mrs. Blake! (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Tom</span></i>) Oh, Mr. Potter, tell Ned! do tell Ned! you’ll do me such a service.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> How? I don’t understand.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Don’t ask me to explain, but tell him! If you will, you’ll make me happier than I’ve been for months. (<i>turns</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> You are unhappy?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> I didn’t mean to say a word about it, but what you’ve told me startled the truth out. I’ve been unhappy for weeks and weeks. I know Ned’s in difficulties, and his estrangement from Sir Humphrey weighs upon his mind. I am the cause of it, and it’s only natural his feelings should have changed; but that makes it no easier to bear. I am a drag upon him, a dishonour! I’m sure he loved me when he married me, but he’s so different now. Oh, Mr. Potter, it may be as you say, love never dies; but love may be so tried, and torn, and strained, that all the happiness goes out of it. (<i>sits on chair, <span class="stage">C.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Lucy</span></i>) Surely, yours hasn’t been so tried?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Not mine—but Ned’s. I always seem to be in his way now. He’s so much occupied—so taken up with other things—he never has a word or look for me. He’s out so much; and when he’s at home he’s always writing or else thinking—I am nobody—and Mrs. Blake—your wife—is everybody; only he doesn’t know she is your wife! If he did, it might make a difference. (<i>rises</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> This may be your fancy. I can quite understand, you’re sensitive, and perhaps misconstrue very simple things. You see, Ned’s an author; (<i><span class="name">Lucy</span> sits</i>) and authors make uninteresting husbands. (<i>crosses to <span class="stage">L.</span></i>) I won’t say they always neglect their wives, but their wives always think so. (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Lucy</span></i>) Then again, Mrs. Blake—as my wife calls herself——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> Alma, Ned calls her!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Well—she’s on the stage and might be of great use to him. It’s only natural he should make friends with her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> But he thinks she’s a widow. If he knew she had a husband—and above all, (<i>rises</i>) that you were her husband—I should feel more comfortable.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Tell him yourself, then. You have my permission. Have the thing out and make an end of it; but for heaven’s sake, don’t brood!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> How can I speak to him?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Speak anyhow—the worse, the better! There are two sides to everything. Why, like those foolish knights, commit yourself to one? At least, have a look at both before you make your choice.</p>

    <p class="entrance"><i>Re-enter <span class="name">Ned,</span> <span class="stage">L.</span></i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Can’t you speak to me? (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Lucy,</span> <span class="stage">R.</span></i>) What a question! Am I the Grand Turk—not to be approached?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> But I mean seriously.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> What have <i>you</i> to be serious about? Doesn’t your new dress fit?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Lucy—(<i><span class="name">Lucy</span> goes up</i>)—you’d better order some more dinner. There’ll be the Dozeys—Potter——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dick.</span> Well, if they want you they shall have you. Now, look here. (<i>to <span class="name">Ned</span></i>) I’ll make you a proposition.

(<i>crosses to <span class="name">Sir Humphrey</span></i>) Believe me when I say I should never have represented myself to be a widow—I should never have entered your house—if I had dreamt it would lead to this. You do believe me? (<i>offers hand</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> (<i>shakes hands</i>) Yes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> It was from no light motive I professed to be what I am not. It was because I wished to strip the memory of my husband from my heart as he has stripped his presence from my life.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> He left you?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Do you care to know? (<i>sits <span class="stage">R.</span></i>) If you can listen to me I should like to tell you. I was a giddy girl when I was young—one who thought nothing of the past and little of the future. My husband was a serious sort of man—absorbed in his pursuit. I thought I was neglected, and—well, it’s a humiliating thing to say, but I must say it—the attention I didn’t get from him I accepted from others. I didn’t doubt he loved me, but he didn’t show it; and I determined that he should. At last I forced him to speak. He wasn’t angry—he used no hard words—but he—he frightened me. I pretended not to care; but I was cured.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> (<i>who has grown more and more interested</i>) Go on.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> With one man I had gone too far to withdraw easily. I was obliged to write to him. It was rather a long letter. When I had written the first sheet I put it in my desk and went on with the next. In the middle of it I was called away on some household matter, and when I returned that second sheet was gone.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Your husband——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Had gone also.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Strange! Very strange! Can you remember what you wrote on it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Nothing he was entitled to resent. But from that day to this I haven’t heard of him. I left Melbourne.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Melbourne?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> I was determined to start life afresh and put an end to old associations. I even went so far as to announce my death.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> You advertised your death?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> It was a wicked thing to do, but I did it. I took the name of Blake, and went on the stage.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> This is much more than strange. If you could find your husband——</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> I’ve no wish to find him!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> But if it turned out there was some mistake—that he misunderstood you?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> There can be no mistake. No! I have done with him for ever. I could never forgive him.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Then you don’t love him?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Yes, I do. That’s why. (<i>rises</i>) And now you know my history, forgive <i>me</i> and let me go.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> (<i>rises</i>) You mustn’t go, Mrs. Blake. I can, perhaps, be of service to you. As for forgiveness, I have nothing to forgive. It isn’t women’s fault men fall in love with them; and men must bear their fate.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> What does this mean? (<i>picks up the ring</i>) Her wedding ring. It isn’t as bright as when I saw it first; but what of that? Six months of marriage take the shine out of a good many wedding-rings. What was it doing there? It couldn’t have dropped off by accident. No—it’s too small for that—it must have been tight. Perhaps it was too tight. That’s it! (<i>crosses to <span class="stage">R.C.</span></i>) That’s it, you may depend. Now, let me think. Under what circumstances does a woman take to throwing rings about? In Sparkle’s comedies they do it in a temper. Clever man—but human nature’s scarcely Sparkle’s forte. Stop!

(<i>crosses to <span class="stage">C.</span></i>) Mrs. Chetwynd’s jealous. Now what has Ned been doing? Whom’s she jealous of? I must find out. She had it on just now—when Ned went out with me.

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> That’s a weight off my mind. (<i>crosses to sofa; sits</i>) You can’t believe how sensitive I am about this play. It is the only link between me and my wife.

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Not an amateur!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dick.</span> Jackson, of Huddersfield, tells me she’s a wonder—a perfect genius for domestic drama.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> How is it he didn’t keep her in Huddersfield? (<i>goes up, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dick.</span> She <i>would</i> come up to town. “Private affairs.” We all know what that means. Got a good-for-nothing husband somewhere, and wants to find him.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Is she in town now?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dick.</span> She’s taken lodgings in this very house.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dick.</span> What’s strange? (<i>sits on sofa</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> That she has chosen this house of all others.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dick.</span> It’s a theatrical place. I recommended it to Blake—Jackson recommended it to Carlton. What is there strange about that?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Nothing, when it’s explained; but it did seem a curious coincidence.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dick.</span> Call that a coincidence? You should have seen my last comedy. Sparkle’s the man for coincidences.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Have you been up to see her?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> What’s she like?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Dick.</span> Very pretty girl—rather washed out, but she’ll be all right at night. Fancy I’ve seen her face before somewhere; but then, I see so many faces—soon forget ’em. Good thing, too; great blessing to forget some faces. (<i>rises; takes hat</i>) Well, I can’t wait all day. Tell Blake I couldn’t stop. You bring the part on to the theatre.

    <p><span class="name">Dick.</span> On second thoughts—(<i>coming down; chuckles</i>)—tell her to send it to the girl upstairs. That’ll take it out of her. Ha, ha, ha, ha! She thought she’d get a rise out of <i>me;</i> but I’ve taken a rise out of <i>her.</i> (<i>Exit, <span class="stage">L.C.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> (<i>sits <span class="stage">R.</span> of table</i>) Another disappointment. I write a part for Alma to create, and it’s to be murdered by an amateur!

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> (<i>sits on sofa</i>) I send the part? Does he imagine I’m the Parcels Post!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> You won’t have to send it far. Miss Carlton’s living in this very house.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Which floor?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> The attic.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> (<i>rises; crosses to <span class="name">Ned</span></i>) That child play my part?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> (<i>rises</i>) You’ve seen her?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> No; I heard all about her from the landlady. She’s been here a week, and never left her room. I’d half a mind to ask her down here for a change of scene, but I shan’t now. (<i>crosses to <span class="stage">L.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Alma</span></i>) Shall I take the part up to her?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> But I say she shall.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> You’ve changed your mind very quickly.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> It’s my own mind; I can do what I like with it, I suppose. I’m not the only changeable person in the world. I know an author who once said he’d written a part specially for me, that I was the only person who <i>could</i> play it, and that I was the only person who should play it; because he thought I was the only person who <i>would</i> play it: and now he’s found another woman, it’s all off. He wants to take the part out of my hands and put it into hers; and a nice mess she’ll make of it, and I hope she will. (<i>goes round sofa, and up to back</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> (<i>crosses to <span class="stage">L.C.</span></i>) How do you know she can’t play the part?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> (<i>following <span class="name">Ned,</span> <span class="stage">L.</span></i>) Because there’s only one woman on the stage who can—and that’s me. That’s how<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-46">[Pg 46]</a></span> I know it; and when your piece is damned, and they shy bricks at you, you’ll know it too. Here, take your part, and take your play, and take your hat, and take your stick, and get out of my room. (<i>thrusting the things on him</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> (<i>going up</i>) I’ll take it to Miss Carlton.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> (<i>stopping him; snatches part back; removes his hat and stick, and bumps him down on sofa</i>) No, you won’t. I tell you she can’t play it! What’s more, she <i>shan’t</i> play it. (<i>tucking it under her arm, and taking stage <span class="stage">R.</span></i>) This part was written for Miss Alma Blake, and no one but Miss Alma Blake shall touch it!

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> (<i>rising; crosses to <span class="name">Alma,</span> overjoyed</i>) You’ve changed your mind again.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> That’s only twice. I’ve changed it twenty times in less time before now—(<i>crosses to <span class="name">Ned</span></i>)—and I shall change it fifty if I like! Why shouldn’t I change my mind? If you had such a nasty, horrid, cantankerous mind as I’ve had for the last five minutes, shouldn’t you be precious <i>glad</i> to change it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> I’m only too delighted.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> So am I.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Alma!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> It’s “Alma” now!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Yes—the old Alma!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> I’m not middle-aged. You’ll make me out a grandmother directly, and say Miss Carlton is my granddaughter. Miss Carlton! Who’s Miss Carlton?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> Here, keep the part and never mind Miss Carlton. I’ll tell Dick——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> No! Stop! Not a word! Now, don’t you interfere between me and my manager. I shall turn up at rehearsal just as usual.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> All right, bother him; he’s bothered <i>me</i> enough! But how are you to get over your notice?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Ignore it altogether—say nothing about it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> But suppose <i>Dick</i> says——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Tell him he dreamt it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> But if he shows your letter?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Tear it to pieces—laugh at him! Oh, I know how to manage Dick. Leave that to me. This happens once a week. (<i>crosses to <span class="stage">R.</span></i> )</p>

    <p><span class="name">Ned.</span> (<i>getting hat and stick</i>) Then I shall see you at rehearsal?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> (<i>sits <span class="stage">L.</span> of table; leaves part on table</i>) Dick took it out of me this morning; I must take it out of him this afternoon. He wouldn’t give me five pounds a week more. All right. He’ll have to give me ten. Mr. Dick must be taught his position. (<i>Re-enter <span class="name">Susan,</span> <span class="stage">L.C.</span></i>) Susan, the brush and comb, and brush out my hair.

    <p><span class="name">Susan.</span> (<i>back of table</i>) No, miss; but Mrs. Pritchard says she looks so ill, and never eats a morsel. She wishes you would speak to her; she seems so lonely.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Do you mean Miss Carlton?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Susan.</span> Yes. Mrs. Pritchard thinks——</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Never mind what Mrs. Pritchard thinks!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Susan.</span> She says she’s always crying.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> What do I care what Mrs. Pritchard says? I asked you if you’d seen her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Susan.</span> No, Miss Blake.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Then go and see her now.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Susan.</span> Yes, Miss Blake.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> I’ll do my hair myself. Don’t mention any name—Mr. Dick’s given her my part to play, and she mightn’t care to see me. Say that the lady on the first floor wants to speak to her on business connected with the theatre.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Susan.</span> Yes, Miss Blake. (<i>crosses at back to <span class="stage">L.C.</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Susan.</span> That’s the third time to-day you’ve given me warning.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> (<i>lifting hair-brush</i>) I’ll give you something else, if you’re not quick. (<i>Exit <span class="name">Susan,</span> <span class="stage">L.C.</span></i>) I feel quite curious to see this girl Dick thinks is good enough to play my part. Some greenhorn at a pound or two a week, or Dick wouldn’t have engaged her. No, she can’t be a greenhorn. She doesn’t eat: greenhorns do. And what did Susan say? She’s always crying. Humph! She must be married. The old tale, I suppose. And yet people go on getting married. (<i>rises; looks for puff</i>) It’s a funny world. What has that Susan done with the powder-puff?  Hang the girl! I’ll give<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-48">[Pg 48]</a></span> her warning again as soon as she comes down. If I had a husband, I believe I should give <i>him</i> warning to-day.

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Lucy</span></i>) To tell the truth, I didn’t know it <i>was</i> you when I sent for you. I thought it was only somebody who had been trying to supplant me in my business.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> And if I had, it would only be just. Haven’t you supplanted me in my home?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> It wasn’t my fault that you left your home. You left because you were suspicious of your husband.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> I had reason to be.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Oh, probably enough! Men are a bad lot, and he’s one of them.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Why did you leave him then? (<i>turning on her quickly</i>) You love him? (<i>thrusting her on sofa, and kneeling down beside her</i>) Yes, you do, or you wouldn’t resent the way I spoke of him; and loving him, you should have trusted him.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> To be deceived!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> Better to trust and be deceived, than to suspect and deceive <i>yourself</i>. You’re a fond, foolish girl, who’ve done your best to wreck your own life and your husband’s too. You’ve done me a great wrong, and now I’m going to have my revenge.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> What wrong have I done <i>you?</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> You think I love your husband, but I don’t. I never loved any man but one—my own. You think your<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-49">[Pg 49]</a></span> husband loves <i>me,</i> but he doesn’t. Nobody loves me—not even my own.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> You say so.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> I will prove it. You think I am your enemy, but I’m your best friend. I’ll show you, you have done me an injustice, and for my revenge—(<i>rises</i>)—I’ll give you back your husband, and forgive you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lucy.</span> (<i>rises</i>) Ned wrote a letter to you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> Mrs. Blake, I was just reminding Mr. Potter of an old fable you may perhaps have heard. Once on a time there were two knights who fought about a certain silver shield. Silver, as one called it—the other called it gold. When they had killed each other, so the story runs, it was discovered both of them were right, and, at the same time,<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-51">[Pg 51]</a></span> both of them were wrong. The shield was gold on one side, silver on the other. Years afterwards the spirits of those knights revisited the earth. They took the form, the one of a young husband, and the other of his wife. They loved one another, but they were unhappy. The wife was a coquette. I’m sure she meant no harm but she incurred her husband’s anger. He remonstrated with her; and the result was she resolved to say good-bye to her admirers. She wrote to one of them to tell him so. When she had written the first sheet she put it in her desk; and in the middle of the next was interrupted. Her husband, finding it, and thinking it was meant for him, left her. (<i>pause</i>) Six years they lived apart. Each had one portion of the letter, and each showed it to a common friend, when it occurred to this same common friend to put the sheets together—(<i>does so</i>)—and lo! he found that each of them was right again, and each of them again was wrong. He took upon him to reverse the sheets—(<i>reverses them</i>)—and asked to hear them read aloud together. (<i>looks at <span class="name">Tom</span></i>) The husband held the first sheet, and began. (<i>hands <span class="name">Alma’s</span> sheet to <span class="name">Tom</span></i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> (<i>reads</i>) “You will consider this a very cruel letter, but I mean it kindly. Something has occurred to show me I’ve been acting very foolishly, and deceiving both my husband and you. You may think me heartless and fickle; but I haven’t really changed. I always loved him in my heart of hearts. I know he doesn’t like me seeing you; and to continue seeing you against his will would be like saying to——”</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> (<i>to whom <span class="name">Sir Humphrey</span> hands <span class="name">Tom’s</span> sheet; reads</i>)—“Tom, I love another more than I love you. (<i>pause</i>) Isn’t it best that we should say good-bye? I have no right to tell you I will never see you, for the fault is mine; but if I do, it will only be painful, and I leave it to your magnanimity to go away from me for ever."</p>

    <p><span class="name">Sir H.</span> I have done. (<i>goes up and turns his back to them, deeply moved; pause</i>)</p>

    <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> And have we lost six years of this short life?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Alma.</span> (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Tom</span></i>) Not lost! if we have learnt to trust appearance less, and one another more.</p>

    <p>French’s Acting Editions from the nineteenth century tend to have minor editorial inconsistencies and errors as well as errors introduced in the printing process, depending on the condition and inking of the plates. Thus, for example, it is at times difficult to determine whether a certain letter is an “c,” “e,” or “o” or whether a certain punctuation mark is a period or a comma. Where context made the choice obvious, the obvious reading was given the benefit of the doubt without comment.</p>

    <p>The following changes were noted:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Throughout the text, all instances of “and” between character names in stage directions are consistently italicized and in lower case. </li>

      <li>Throughout the text, all instances of “L.C.” and “R.C.” have been made consistent so that there is no space between them.</li>

      <li>Throughout the text, the use of dashes has been made consistent.</li>

      <li>p. 3: Can’t you see the likeness—Added a question mark to the end of the sentence.</li>

      <li>p. 5: …to bear the purring cat…—Changed “bear” to “hear”.</li>

      <li>p. 9: (<i>arranges hersel before the glass</i>)—Changed “hersel” to “herself”.</li>

      <li>p. 9: graually gets round, and down—Changed “graually” to “gradually”.</li>

      <li>p. 12: Scrubbs is the man for skies, —Changed comma after “skies” to a period.</li>

      <li>p. 13: What nonsense I never met you…—Added an exclamation mark after “nonsense”.</li>

      <li>p. 14: …should have said nothing, We don’t…—Changed comma to a period.</li>

      <li>p. 16: (<i>embraces Dr. <span class="name">Dozey,</span> while <span class="name">Alma</span> shakes…</i>—Changed “Dr.” to small caps in html version or all caps in text version.</li>

      <li>p. 18: What’s the matter, Mrs. <span class="name">Dozey?</span>—Changed small caps in printing of “Dozey” to initial cap.</li>

      <li>p. 19: I believe you’re smitten Men are all alike.—Added period after “smitten”.</li>

      <li>p. 23: <i><span class="name">Lucy</span> sits  R.</i>—Added a comma after “sits” in space that appeared to be left for one.</li>

      <li>p. 30: I don’t read plays, sir; I produce em.—Added an apostrophe before “em”.</li>

      <li>p. 32: You may—you may It’s quite a relief to hear a little bad language.—Added a period between “may” and “It’s”.</li>

      <li>p. 38: (<i>Exit through window off, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>) <i><span class="name">Servant</span> closes window…</i>—Deleted closing parenthesis after “L.”.</li>

      <li>p. 39: <span class="name">Mrs. D.</span> It’ an elopement!—Added an “s” after the apostrophe.</li>

      <li>p. 42: you can t be sorry for me, Miss Blake.—Added an apostrophe between “can” and “t”.</li>

      <li>p. 47: Say that the lady on the first floor wants t speak to her on business…—Changed “t” to “to”.</li>

      <li>p. 51: I have no right to tell you I will; never see you…—Deleted semicolon.</li>

      <li>p. 54: <span class="name">Dr.</span> (<i>rising: also <span class="name">Mrs. Dozey</span></i>)—Changed colon to semicolon for consistency.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="noindent">Variant spellings such as “bran new” and “weazel” were not changed.</p>

    <p>The html version of this etext attempts to reproduce the layout of the printed text. However, some concessions have been made. For example, the spacing above and below the stage directions has been standardized, and in the stage directions, no attempt was made to reproduce whether the punctuation was italicized. Thus, if a punctuation mark was adjacent to an html &lt;span&gt; tag, it was included within the &lt;span&gt; group. This prevents line breaks in the display text of some ereaders right before the punctuation mark.</p>
